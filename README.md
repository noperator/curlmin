# curlmin - Curl Request Minimizer

A CLI tool that minimizes curl commands by removing unnecessary headers, cookies, and query parameters while ensuring the response remains the same. This is especially handy when copying a network request "as cURL" in Chrome DevTools' Network panel (Right-click page > Inspect > Network > Right-click request > Copy > Copy as cURL) as shown in this example:

## Description

I use Chrome's "Copy as cURL" _a lot_ (so much, in fact, that I wrote [sol](https://github.com/noperator/sol) partially just to help me auto-format long curl commands). I often have this problem where the copied curl command contains a bunch of garbage (namely, extra headers and cookies for tracking purposes) that isn't at all relevant to the actual request being made. After years of manually trimming out cookies in order to see which ones are actually necessary to maintain a stateful authenticated session, I finally decided to make a tool to automate the minification of a curl command.

### How it works

1. Parses the curl command into a syntax tree üå≥
2. Makes a baseline request to get the expected response üìú
3. Iteratively removes headers, cookies, and query parameters one by one ‚úÇÔ∏è
4. After each removal, makes a new request and compares the response to the baseline  üßê
5. If the response is the same, removes the unnecessary element üöÆ
6. Returns final minimized curl command üéÅ

### Features

- Choose which request elements you want to **minimize**: headers, cookies, or query parameters. Minimizes all by default.
- Choose which features of the response you want to **compare** against the baseline request: status code, body content, or body line/word/byte count. Compares body content by default.

## Getting started

### Install

```
go install github.com/noperator/curlmin/cmd/curlmin@latest
```

### Usage

```
Usage of curlmin:
      --body             Compare body content (default true)
      --bytes            Compare byte count
  -c, --command string   Curl command as a string
      --cookies          Minimize cookies (default true)
  -f, --file string      File containing the curl command
      --headers          Minimize headers (default true)
      --lines            Compare line count
      --params           Minimize query parameters (default true)
      --status           Compare status code
  -v, --verbose          Verbose output
      --words            Compare word count
```

You can provide the curl command in one of three ways:
1. Using the `--command` or `-c` flag to specify the curl command as a string
2. Using the `--file` or `-f` flag to read the curl command from a file (use `-f -` to read from stdin)
3. Piping the curl command directly to curlmin (e.g., `cat curl.sh | curlmin`)

Use the provided test server to see how it works. Consider using the `-v` flag with `curlmin` so you can watch it progressively strip down the curl command.

```
# start test server requiring a few auth-related items
go run testserver/server.go
Starting test server on http://localhost:8080
Required authentication:
  Cookie: session=abc123
  Auth Token: Bearer xyz789
  Query Parameter: auth_key=def456

# generate the following test curl command and pipe to curlmin
# curl \
#     -H 'Authorization: Bearer xyz789' \
#     -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36' \
#     -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml' \
#     -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
#     -H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0' \
#     -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
#     -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' \
#     -H 'Cookie: _ga=GA1.2.1234567890.1623456789; session=abc123; _gid=GA1.2.9876543210.1623456789' \
#     -H 'Cookie: _fbp=fb.1.1623456789.1234567890' \
#     -H 'Cookie: _gat=1; thisis=notneeded' \
#     -b 'preference=dark; language=en; theme=blue' \
#     'http://localhost:8080/api/test?auth_key=def456&timestamp=1623456789&tracking_id=abcdef123456&utm_source=test&utm_medium=cli&utm_campaign=curlmin'
go run testserver/cmd/generate_test_curl.go | curlmin

# prints this resulting minimized command
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer xyz789' -H 'Cookie: session=abc123' 'http://localhost:8080/api/test?auth_key=def456'
```

### Troubleshooting

Since this tool actually executes the curl command to check the server response, that remote server actually needs to be _running_. So if you see this error, make sure you can actually reach the server you're validating the command against.

```
# didn't start test server (see example above)
go run testserver/cmd/generate_test_curl.go | curlmin
Error minimizing curl command: failed to get baseline response: failed to execute curl command: exit status 7, stderr:
exit status 1
```

### To-do

- [ ] optional delay between requests
- [ ] detect session expiration
- [ ] consolidate testing logic
- [x] recognize `-` for reading from stdin
- [ ] document library usage
- [ ] group cli options
- [ ] handle joined flags, like `-skvL`
